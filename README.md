# Design Patterns

[This repository](https://github.com/jlengrand/design-patterns) is a bunch of tests I have written while reading [Head First Design Patterns].

You'll find simple implementations of some of those Design Patterns, with ideally some doc attached to them.


## Running the code

I've built this using Java 14, so it might be incompatible with lower versions. The amount of dependencies is extremely minimal.
The easiest is probably to run this in your favourite IDE.
