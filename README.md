# Design Patterns

[This repository](https://github.com/jlengrand/design-patterns) is a bunch of tests I have written while reading [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do).

You'll find simple implementations of some of those Design Patterns, with some doc attached to them. This is not an exact copy of the exmaples in the book, I usually wrote my own.

## Implemented patterns : 

You can find the patterns implemented, one per Java package in the code.

List of implemented patterns :

* [Adapter pattern](src/main/java/nl/lengrand/patterns/adapter/README.md)
* [Command pattern](src/main/java/nl/lengrand/patterns/command/README.md)
* [Facade pattern](src/main/java/nl/lengrand/patterns/facade/README.md)

## Running the code

I've built this using Java 11, so it might be incompatible with lower versions. The amount of dependencies is extremely minimal.
The easiest is probably to run this in your favourite IDE, or to run `$./gradlew build`.
