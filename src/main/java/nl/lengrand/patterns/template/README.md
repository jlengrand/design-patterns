# Template method pattern

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern).

The template method is a method in a superclass, usually an abstract superclass, and defines the skeleton of an operation in terms of a number of high-level steps.
The intent of the template method is to define the overall structure of the operation, while allowing subclasses to refine, or redefine, certain steps. The template method pattern is an example of inversion of control.

This pattern is useful to reduce code duplication for variations of the same algorithm.
