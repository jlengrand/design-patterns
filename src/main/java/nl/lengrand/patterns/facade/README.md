# Facade pattern

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern)

A facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code. A facade can:

* improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single (and often simplified) API
* provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality (complete with context-specific input validation)
* serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code
